#### [Tidygeocoder](https://jessecambon.github.io/tidygeocoder/)

Tidygeocoder is an R package for geocoding. You read more about it on [its website](https://jessecambon.github.io/tidygeocoder/) and its [Journal of Open Source Software publication](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.03544).

#### [Data Science "Sandbox"](https://github.com/jessecambon/Data-Science-Sandbox)

A loosely organized collection of Python and R code for data science projects. I sporadically update this repository with new code snippets and examples I think could be useful to have for reference in the future.
