I'm a data scientist at [Booz Allen Hamilton](https://www.boozallen.com/) and the author of the R package [tidygeocoder](https://jessecambon.github.io/tidygeocoder/). I maintain a loosely organized collection of R and Python code for data science projects [in this GitHub repository](https://github.com/jessecambon/Data-Science-Codex) and you can reach me by email <a href="mailto:{{ site.author.email }}">here</a>.

R-related posts also appear on [R-Bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/) and [RWeekly](https://rweekly.org/). This site is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and the [minima theme](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) and its Github repository is [here](https://github.com/jessecambon/jessecambon.github.io).
