I have used mainly python and R for my work and have interests in machine learning, Bayesian statistics, natural language processing (NLP), and data visualization. Tidygeocoder related posts can be found [here](/tag/tidygeocoder) and you can reach me by email <a href="mailto:{{ site.author.email }}">here</a>.
