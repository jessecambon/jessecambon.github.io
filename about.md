I'm a data scientist at [Embedded Healthcare](https://www.embeddedhealthcare.com/) and the creator of the R package [tidygeocoder](https://jessecambon.github.io/tidygeocoder/). Tidygeocoder related posts can be found [here](/tag/tidygeocoder) and you can reach me by email <a href="mailto:{{ site.author.email }}">here</a>.

[R-related posts](/tag/r) appear on [R-Bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/) and [RWeekly](https://rweekly.org/). This site is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with the [minima theme](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) and its Github repository is [here](https://github.com/jessecambon/jessecambon.github.io).
