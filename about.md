#### About Me

I'm a machine learning engineer at [Booz Allen](https://www.boozallen.com/) where I work on large language model applications for healthcare use cases. I'm also the creator of the R package [tidygeocoder](https://jessecambon.github.io/tidygeocoder/). You can reach me by email <a href="mailto:{{ site.author.email }}">here</a> and my resume is available below. Outside of work and data, I enjoy photography and you can find some of my photos on [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/jessecambon/) or [flickr](https://www.flickr.com/people/144575322@N06/).
