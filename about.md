#### About Me

I'm a data scientist at [Lighthouse](https://www.lighthouseglobal.com/) where I work on a [machine learning platform for document review](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210201005774/en/Lighthouse-Launches-New-AI-Enhanced-Ediscovery-and-Document-Review-Technology). I'm also the creator of the R package [tidygeocoder](https://jessecambon.github.io/tidygeocoder/).  My resume is available [here](https://jessecambon.github.io/files/jesse_cambon_resume_public.pdf).
