## README

My personal blog

#### Operational Notes

- [Ruby 101](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/ruby-101/)

* Check for errors: `jekyll doctor`
* Build for deployment: `jekyll build`
* To preview blog with draft posts (posts stored in `_drafts` folder): `jekyll serve --drafts`

Note: you may have to prepend jekyll commands with `bundle exec`

#### Code Notes

* `/feed.xml` is generated by the jekyll-feed plugin while `/r.xml` is a feed exclusively for the `r` tag that is generated by the [r.xml](r.xml) script. Both `feed.xml` and `r.xml` are generated when `jekyll build` is run.
* When `jekyll build` is run, scripts such as `r.xml` are run and the resulting data and content is put into the `_site` folder which generates the site.
* Configure `_config.yml` as necessary to configure site-wide variables and settings. Use `exclude:` to exclude files (such as `README.md`) from the jekyll build process. Use `header_pages:` to add additional pages to the site.
* [_sass](_sass) contains the CSS styling

#### Atom XML Feed

For R-Bloggers I needed to create a custom feed that only contained R content. My solution was to make all R posts contain the `tag` "r" and then use jekyll to build an r.xml file. The file in root, [r.xml](r.xml) is what builds the feed. I first tried to use [https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-feed](jekyll-feed) to build a feed for a specific tag or category, but was unable to get it to work.

* Atom XML Feed Verifier: https://validator.w3.org/feed/
* Can use a RSS aggregator like [feedly](https://feedly.com/) for checking the content.

#### Other Modifications

- Post tag pages added per [these instructions](https://longqian.me/2017/02/09/github-jekyll-tag/)
- Leaflet Javascript library added based on [this](https://github.com/dieghernan/dieghernan.github.io/blob/master/_includes/leaflet.html). See [_includes/leaflet.html](_includes/leaflet.html)

#### Other Notes

* Installing jekyll: `gem install jekyll bundler`
* Installing the bundle: `bundle install`
* Updating the bundle: `bundle update`

* Ran into an issue with two versions of jekyll. Had to apt remove jekyll per https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/7088 (ie. only install the gem)
* Had to copy 'assets' and '_sass' folders from minima github (release file) into this repo to fix file not found errors

#### Blogging with Jupyter Notebooks

Steps for using jupyter notebooks to create a blog post:

- Add the desired YAML header to the beginning of the jupyter notebook in a raw cell. Include the beginning and trailing `---`. For example:

```
---
layout: post
title: "Test Jupyter Post"
date: 2021-10-17
author: Jesse Cambon
tags: [python, data]
image: "/images/tidygeocoder_hex_dark2021.png"
---
```

Now run the [build_jupyter.py](build_jupyter.py) script on your notebook:

```sh
python build_jupyter.py path/to/notebook.ipynb
```

This script will create a .md file in the same directory as jupyter notebook. The script handles moving all the image files to the [jupyter_files](jupyter_files) directory and fixing the image references within the newly created markdown file.

**IMPORTANT**: 
- If you include images within your juypter notebook, make sure the alternative text is not "png" (ie. do not do this: `![png](/path/to/image.jpg)`) The build_jupyter.py script will edit image paths with the alt text png to point to the jupyter files directory (if there are graphs within the notebook that generate images).
