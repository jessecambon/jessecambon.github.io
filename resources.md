A work-in-progress collection of resources I find useful for data science work. These resources are all freely available online unless otherwise noted.

### Blogs

- [RStudio's Blog](https://blog.rstudio.com/)
- [Julia Silge](https://juliasilge.com/) - Lots of great walkthroughs of machine learning problems with [tidymodels](https://www.tidymodels.org/)
- [Andrew Gelman](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/) - Bayesian statistics
- [TJ Mahr](https://www.tjmahr.com/) - R and Bayesian stats
- [Simply Statistics](https://simplystatistics.org/)
- [David Robinson](http://varianceexplained.org/) - R and machine learning
- [Monica Alexander](https://www.monicaalexander.com) - Bayesian statistics and demography
- [Frank Harrell](https://www.fharrell.com/) - Biostatistics
- [Richard McElreath](https://elevanth.org/blog/)

### Books

- [Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://www.statlearning.com/) - A great practical statistics and data science textbook with a very broad scope. The second edition includes survival analysis and neural network models.
- [Statistical Rethinking (Richard McElreath)](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/) - Very useful for understanding Bayesian statistical methods. The book is not freely available online, but there are lots of related resources that are such as [Statistical rethinking with brms (Solomon Kurz)](https://bookdown.org/content/4857/) and [video lectures on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDcUM9US4XdNM4Edgs7weiyIguLSToZRI).
- [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html) - An introduction to R
- [Regression and Other Stories](https://avehtari.github.io/ROS-Examples/index.html) - An applied textbook on Bayesian statistics. Makes use of the [rstanarm package](https://mc-stan.org/rstanarm/). Not freely available online, but there are code examples provided on the website.
- [Telling Stories With Data (Rohan Alexander)](https://www.tellingstorieswithdata.com/) - Practical applications of R and Bayesian statistics
- [Forecasting - Principles and Practice](https://otexts.com/fpp2/) - Textbook on time series and forecasting methods
- [Text Mining with R](https://www.tidytextmining.com/)

- [Tidymodels Documentation](https://www.tidymodels.org/learn/)
- [Data Science Digest](https://thedatasciencedigest.substack.com/)
- [Distill](https://distill.pub/) - Machine learning concepts explained intuitively
