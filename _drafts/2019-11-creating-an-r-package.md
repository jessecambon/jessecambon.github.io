I recently created [my first R package](https://github.com/jessecambon/tidygeocoder) because I wanted to have a simple way to use geocoding services like the US Census in R. Creating an R package can seem like a daunting task. ....

If you have written functions in R that would be useful others in the R community, a great way to share this work is with an R package. Thanks to some helpful developer tools, the process of creating and publishing an R package can be much easier than it might seem.

### Getting Started
* [Install R-Studio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/)
* We will be generating our documentation with [roxygen2](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/roxygen2/index.html). This will allow us to generate all of our `man` documentation from embedded coments in our `R` code files. 

### File Layout

##### Important Files
* `DESCRIPTION`: Contains important infornation about your package such as dependencies, author info, and your license.
* `.Rbuildignore`: list files and folders you do not want to include in your R package. Include files and directories that aren't part of the standard R package format such as `/data-raw` and `/README.md`.
* `projectname.Rproj` : RStudio project file. Don't lose this.

##### Main Folders
* `R`: store your R code here.
* `data`: datasets will be stored here. If you have scripts and data sources that you use to create this data, save them in a separate `data-raw` folder and then be sure to add this directory to your `.Rbuildignore` file.
* `man`: Documentation generated by `roxygen2` with embedded content in your `R` code files.
* `tests`: Use the [testthat](https://testthat.r-lib.org/) library to create functional tests for your package. Some properly written and easy to run tests will help give you some peace of mind that your latest bugfix hasn't broken some other part of the package.
* `vignettes`: vignettes are short examples that demonstrate the functionality of your package. Create a `.Rmd` in this directory to create one.
