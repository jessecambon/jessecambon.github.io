IMPORTANT: This file must be kept in a subfolder of the root project directory.
If this is not the case then adjust the `project_dir` argument

Reference: http://svmiller.com/blog/2019/08/two-helpful-rmarkdown-jekyll-tips/

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# set project directory to parent directory of this script 
project_dir <- normalizePath("../")
#print(project_dir)
knitr::opts_knit$set(base.dir = project_dir, base.url = "/") # project root folder
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.path = "rmd_images/",echo=TRUE) # image path
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
